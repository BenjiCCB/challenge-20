# ReadMe - Module 19 Challenge üìù

## Description 

This progressive web app is a browser-based text editor, featuring a number of data persistence techniques. Through the app, users can add text, and click off the main window to store the info to the IndexedDB browser databse, which can then be redisplayed across page refreshes.  The app uses webpack to conolidate all files for distribution, confirm backwards-compatibility of javascript, and create a manifest that can be used to download the app so as to run standalone locally.  The app also uses service workers to cache content, to minimize load times and allow for offline interaction

## Usage Information 

Once a user's application is running, they can use the main interface to add or remove text.  On clicking off the main window, changes are saved to the browser's IndexedDB database to store across page sessions.  A user can also download the app by hitting the install button, which will create a local version the progressive web app to use offline and otherwise

Notes:
* The app's ASCII-art main display will show on intital site visit, or after clearing site data from the browser's console
* The local, downloaded version of the app will stay in sync with the browser version
* On download, the app will no longer display the install prompt, unless/until the app is uninstalled locally
